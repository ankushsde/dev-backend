→ Start by picking a real, practical problem that exists in the world.
Don’t worry about being perfect, focus on breaking it down, piece by piece.

→ Design the system end-to-end, step by step.
Figure out the requirements, make assumptions, draw rough sketches, even if they seem “wrong” at first.

→ Hit roadblocks? That’s your cue to Google, read, or ask questions.
Let your questions pull you to the right resources; don’t force-feed yourself theory until you actually need it.

Just like LeetCode makes you learn by solving, system design gets way easier when you focus on building rather than cramming. Pick a real problem and design it end-to-end.
